# SkyInfer

A deep learning inference framework in development. 

The ultimate goal is to customise SkyInfer with my interests, supporting most models on multiple platforms. 

I choose **PyTorch Neural Network eXchange(PNNX)** as the standard of model format. Refer this: https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/tree/master/tools/pnnx
